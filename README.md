# PULSE-WIDTH-AND-FREQUENCY-MEASUREMENT-USING-AT89C52-Development-Board
The project's major goal is to design a system that accurately measures input signal frequency and duty cycle. An 8051 microcontroller will capture and analyze the signal and show the measured results on an LCD. The device will also notify and display the frequency deviation on the LCD screen if it deviates from 50Hz.
